# Neural Image Super-Resolution (Colabs)

❗️ This repository is not actively maintained since 2023, as closed-source state-of-the-art superresolution solutions are now widely available for everyone.

This is a collection of simplified Colab Notebooks for various neural image enhancers in an attempt to enlarge low resolution images with restored details in high quality. All notebooks support batch processing of an entire directory. All notebooks were made to run in Google Colaboratory, using Google Drive as data source and storage.

## Latent Diffusion + FBCNN

**Colab for:** [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) + [FBCNN](https://github.com/jiaxi-jiang/FBCNN) <br>
**Papers:** High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752; Towards Flexible Blind JPEG Artifacts Removal https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14573

Upscale by Latent Diffusion:

Sharpen by Latent Diffusion & remove JPEG artifacts by FBCNN (this notebook does not increase image resolution):

## ESRGAN

Works in Jun 2021.

**Colab for:** [JoeyBallentine's fork](https://github.com/JoeyBallentine/ESRGAN) of [BlueAmulet's fork](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/ESRGAN) of [ESRGAN by Xinntao](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN). <br>
**Paper:** ESRGAN: Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219

You can add more pretrained models from [upscale.wiki](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database), probably.

## Older

Older notebooks are probably inferior and possibly outdated.

**Colab for:** [uperresolution_gan](https://github.com/fukumame/superresolution_gan). <br>
